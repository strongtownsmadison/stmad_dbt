    description: >
      This macro generates the SQL for joining a generalized set of geospatial polygons to the tax parcel polygons. This helps keeps consistency and reduces repetition when introducing new overlays into the project.

      Tax parcels are attributed by calculating the area of intersection with the provided overlay, then ranked based on the largest area of intersection.

      Typical downstream usage would select the result where intersect_rank = 1 (largest intersection).


      Returns a SQL statement with the following columns:

      parcel_id, parcel_year, <overlay_name>, intersect_area, intersect_rank


      Example: To join the city of Madison's area plans to tax parcels, we would use the macro like so:

        {%raw%}{{ apply_overlay_to_parcels('area_plans_localize_geom','area_plans','area_plan')}}{%endraw%}

        area_plans_localize_geom: A reference that contains the geometry of the area plan and the area plan name

        area_plans: The alias to be used in the compiled SQL

        area_plan: The column name from the reference that contains the area plan names
        
    arguments:
      - name: overlay_ref
        type: string
        description: The reference that contains the polygons of the overlay.
      - name: overlay_alias
        type: string
        description: The alias to be used for the overlay reference.
      - name: overlay_name
        type: string
        description: The column name that contains the name of the individual overlays.
