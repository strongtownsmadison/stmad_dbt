  - name: generate_fact_overlay
    description: >
      This macro builds upon the apply_overlay_to_parcels and apply_overlay_to_streets macros to collect metrics from tax parcels and streets, aggregating them into a given overlay.
      This ensures a consistent treatment and column set when adding new overlays into the data, reducing the maintenance burden with future updates.
      Currently, it is assumed that the model leveraging apply_overlay_to_parcels is joined to parcels and the <overlay_name> column is available in the fact_parcels model. For streets, it is assumed that the model that joins streets to the overlay is named "streets_join_<overlay_alias>".

      
      The SQL aggregates facts about parcels, grouping by the overlay, aggregates facts about streets, grouping by the overlay, then joins the two based on the overlay.


      Example: To generate fact_area_plans, which aggregates parcel and street data for each area plan, use the macro like so in a dbt model:

        {%raw%}{{ generate_fact_overlay('area_plans_localize_geom','area_plans','area_plan')}}{%endraw%}

        area_plans_localize_geom: A reference that contains the geometry of the area plan and the area plan name

        area_plans: The alias to be used in the compiled SQL

        area_plan: The column name from the reference that contains the area plan names
        
    arguments:
      - name: overlay_ref
        type: string
        description: The reference that contains the polygons of the overlay.
      - name: overlay_alias
        type: string
        description: The alias to be used for the overlay reference.
      - name: overlay_name
        type: string
        description: The column name that contains the name of the individual overlays.
